Install To install the package from PyPI: pip install logaut==0.1.0a0 Make sure to have Lydia installed on your machine. We suggest the following setup: Install Docker Download the Lydia Docker image: docker pull whitemech/lydia:latest Run the following commands: echo 'docker run -v$(pwd):/home/default -it whitemech/lydia lydia $@' > lydia sudo chmod u+x lydia sudo mv lydia /usr/local/bin/ This will install an alias to the inline Docker image execution in your system PATH. Instead of /usr/local/bin/ you may use another path which is still in the PATH variable. Quickstart Now you are ready to go: from logaut import ltl2dfa from pylogics.parsers import parse_ltl formula = parse_ltl ( \"F(a)\" ) dfa = ltl2dfa ( formula , backend = \"lydia\" ) The function ltl2dfa takes in input a pylogics formula and gives in output a pythomata DFA. Then, you can manipulate the DFA as done with Pythomata, e.g. to print: dfa.to_graphviz().render(\"eventually.dfa\") Currently, the lydia backend only supports the ltl and ldl logics. The ltlf2dfa , based on LTLf2DFA , supports ltl and pltl . First, install it at version 1.0.1 : pip install git + https : // github . com / whitemech / LTLf2DFA . git @develop #egg = ltlf2dfa Then, you can use: from logaut import pltl2dfa from pylogics.parsers import parse_pltl formula = parse_pltl ( \"a S b\" ) dfa = pltl2dfa ( formula , backend = \"ltlf2dfa\" ) Write your own backend You can write your back-end by implementing the Backend interface: from logaut.backends.base import Backend class MyBackend ( Backend ): def ltl2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From LTL to DFA.\"\"\" def ldl2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From LDL to DFA.\"\"\" def pltl2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From PLTL to DFA.\"\"\" def pldl2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From PLDL to DFA.\"\"\" def fol2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From FOL to DFA.\"\"\" def mso2dfa ( self , formula : Formula ) -> DFA : \"\"\"From MSO to DFA.\"\"\" Then, you can register the custom backend class in the library: from logaut.backends import register register ( id_ = \"my_backend\" , entry_point = \"dotted.path.to.MyBackend\" ) And then, use it through the main entry point: dfa = ltl2dfa ( formula , backend = \"my_backend\" ) Tests To run tests: tox To run only the code tests: tox -e py3.7 To run only the linters: - tox -e flake8 - tox -e mypy - tox -e black-check - tox -e isort-check Please look at the tox.ini file for the full list of supported commands.
